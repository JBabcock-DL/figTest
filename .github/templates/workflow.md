# claude-ops — Agent Workflow Context

This document describes how this project is structured and how work is tracked. All agents operating in this repo should follow this workflow.

## Ticket Backend

<!-- CONFIGURE: set to either `github` or `jira` during /project-start. Agents must read this field to know which backend to use. -->

**Backend:** `jira`

Exactly one of the two **Ticket Tracker** sections below applies, based on the backend above. The other section is marked N/A.

### memory.md and CLAUDE.md (recommended)

- **`CLAUDE.md`** at the repository root (created by `/project-start`) tells Claude to **read `memory.md` first** and **update it** when durable facts change—**the user should not have to repeat those instructions.** Keep the **Agent rules** block when editing that file.
- **`memory.md`** holds short, project-level facts: backend choice, default branch, stack, build/git defaults, naming conventions, integration pointers, and “do not repeat” notes. Read it at session start, then `workflow.md` for the full spec. This keeps sessions cheaper on context and tokens.
- `ticket.md` / `plan.md` remain the source of truth for a single unit of work; do not duplicate per-ticket steps into `memory.md`.

## Ticket Types

| Type | Label | Template | Naming | Lifecycle |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Bug | `bug` | `bug_report.md` | `BUG-{N}-{slug}` | Full lifecycle (create → research → plan → build → vqa) |
| Work Order | `work-order` | `work_order.md` | `WO-{N}-{slug}` | Full lifecycle (create → research → plan → build → vqa) |
| Context | `context` | `context.md` | `CTX-{N}-{slug}` | Triage — raw dumps **or** design-handoff scaffold; must be promoted to `bug` or `work-order` before research / planning / building |

Each type has its own sequential numbering (`BUG-001`, `BUG-002`, `WO-001`, `CTX-001`, etc.).

### Context tickets

Context tickets are an intake format for **bulk raw information** — designer notes, research transcripts, meeting dumps, Figma comments, Slack threads, customer interviews, analytics observations.

**`context.md` ships two intake shapes:** (1) **Design handoff (default scaffold)** — Goal, Design reference, Requirements (functional / visual / technical), Acceptance criteria, Out of scope, and Notes for build agent — use this when dropping **Figma → engineering** work or running `/dev-handoff` so a build agent can scope a task **before** promotion. (2) **Raw dump** — lean on Source, Summary, Raw Notes, and Assets & Links; leave structured sections empty or `TBD` when no UI/code scope exists yet. Bug and work-order tickets still use **`bug_report.md`** / **`work_order.md`** for fully structured Requirements / Success Criteria **after** promotion.

A context ticket stays in **Context Backlog** until it is **promoted** into the correct type:
- `/create-ticket promote {CTX-ID}` — interactively promote a single CTX ticket into a `bug` or `work-order`
- `/create-backlog` — bulk-triage every unpromoted CTX ticket in the current sprint, classifying each into a `bug` or `work-order` (with user confirmation per ticket)

The `/research`, `/plan`, `/build`, and `/vqa` skills refuse to run on an un-promoted `CTX-*` ticket and will point the user at `/create-ticket promote` or `/create-backlog` first.

---

## Ticket Lifecycle

0. **Intake (optional)** — `/create-ticket ctx "..."` drops raw context into a CTX ticket without forcing structure. CTX tickets are triaged later via `/create-ticket promote {CTX-ID}` (single) or `/create-backlog` (batch), which converts each into a `bug` or `work-order` with the next sequential ID of that type.
1. **Create ticket** — `/create-ticket` requires a configured **Ticket Backend** in `workflow.md`, creates the **remote** issue first (GitHub Issue + Project, or Jira), then writes the sprint folder, `ticket.md`, and stub `plan.md` (bug / work-order only), with board/status: **Context Backlog**
2. **Research** *(optional, recommended for unfamiliar work)* — `/research` investigates the problem domain and writes findings to `research/`; moves ticket to **In Research**
3. **Plan** — `/plan` enters plan mode for interactive review, writes the approved plan to `plan.md` (including a `## Build Agents` section defining parallel phases), and moves ticket to **In Planning**
4. **Build** — `/build` reads the `## Build Agents` section, moves ticket to **In Build**, and spawns build agents in parallel phases; agents within a phase run simultaneously, phases run sequentially. Individual build skills (`/code-build`, `/doc-build`, `/script-build`, `/api-build`, `/figma-build`) can be used directly for single-domain tickets.
5. **Verify** — `/vqa` runs a QA pass; moves ticket to **In Review** → **Completed**

> Skip research for well-understood, mechanical tickets where requirements are unambiguous.

The six workflow phases are:

| Phase | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Context Backlog | Ticket created, not yet started |
| In Research | Discovery / investigation underway |
| In Planning | plan.md being drafted or refined |
| In Build | Build agents executing the plan |
| In Review | VQA pass in progress |
| Completed | Verified, done |

These phases are stored on each ticket:
- **GitHub backend** → as the Status single-select field on the Project board
- **Jira backend** → as a `phase:<name>` label on each Jira issue (e.g. `phase:in-build`), because Jira workflow transitions depend on project-level configuration we cannot assume. The Jira Status field is left at whatever default the project workflow provides.

## Ticket Tracker — GitHub

**N/A** — this project uses the Jira backend; see the Jira section below.

---

## Ticket Tracker — Jira

All Jira operations go through the **Atlassian MCP server** available to Claude Code (official Atlassian Remote MCP). Agents discover exact tool names through the MCP descriptor / tool list — do NOT shell out or call the Jira REST API directly.

- **Cloud ID:** `a36c44c1-853d-4ac5-b0ca-ed9130bf5e6d`
- **Site URL:** `https://detroitlabs.jira.com`
- **Project key:** `JAK`
- **Project name:** `jakeTest`
- **Issue type — Bug:** `Bug`
- **Issue type — Work Order:** `Workorder`
- **Issue type — Context:** `Context`

### Phase Labels (Jira)

Phases are tracked as **labels** on each Jira issue (not Status), so no workflow customization is required in the target Jira project. Exactly one `phase:*` label should be set at a time — when transitioning phases, remove the previous `phase:*` label and add the new one.

| Phase | Label |
|---|---|
| Context Backlog | `phase:context-backlog` |
| In Research | `phase:in-research` |
| In Planning | `phase:in-planning` |
| In Build | `phase:in-build` |
| In Review | `phase:in-review` |
| Completed | `phase:completed` |

In addition, every ticket created by this workflow gets a `claude-ops` label for easy JQL filtering, plus exactly one type label: `bug`, `work-order`, or `context`. When a context ticket is promoted via `/create-ticket promote` or `/create-backlog`, the `context` label is removed and replaced with `bug` or `work-order`, and the Jira `issuetype` field is updated accordingly.

### Key Operations (Jira)

Use the Atlassian MCP tools. Typical tool names on the official Atlassian Remote MCP:

| Operation | MCP tool (typical name — confirm via the MCP tool descriptors before calling) |
|---|---|
| List cloud IDs | `getAccessibleAtlassianResources` |
| List Jira projects on a cloud | `getVisibleJiraProjects` |
| Create a Jira issue | `createJiraIssue` |
| Read a Jira issue | `getJiraIssue` |
| Edit fields / labels on a Jira issue | `editJiraIssue` |
| Transition a Jira issue's Status (if desired) | `transitionJiraIssue` |
| Search issues (by label, JQL) | `searchJiraIssuesUsingJql` |

Phase-transition pattern (in pseudocode — replace with actual MCP tool call):

```
# Move ticket to a new phase
current = getJiraIssue(issueKey)
newLabels = [l for l in current.labels if not l.startswith("phase:")] + ["phase:in-build"]
editJiraIssue(issueKey, { labels: newLabels })
```

JQL to list all claude-ops tickets currently in build:

```
project = JAK AND labels = "claude-ops" AND labels = "phase:in-build"
```

## MCP Integrations

MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers extend what agents can do within this workflow — connecting to external tools, APIs, and platforms without leaving the ticket lifecycle. Any MCP-driven work should still be tied to a ticket.

### General conventions for MCP work
- Reference any external resource URLs (files, boards, APIs) in `ticket.md` under **References**
- Document what was read, written, or changed via MCP in `plan.md` after completion
- MCP tool calls are treated as implementation steps — they belong in the work phase, after a plan exists

### Available MCP servers

#### Figma
Read designs, write to the Figma canvas, manage variables and component code connections.

#### Atlassian (Jira / Confluence)
Used as the ticket backend when **Backend** above is set to `jira`. Also available on `github`-backed projects for reading or cross-posting to a Jira/Confluence workspace when a ticket references one.

## Conventions

- `CLAUDE.md` at the repository root (from `/project-start`) must keep its **Agent rules** so Claude reads and updates `memory.md` without the user asking. **`memory.md`** holds short, project-wide facts; update it when something stable and reusable changes. Do not use either file to replace `ticket.md` or `plan.md` for a specific ticket
- Ticket IDs are sequential per type (`BUG-001`, `BUG-002`, `WO-001`, `WO-002`, `CTX-001`, `CTX-002`) and are always prefixed onto the remote issue title
- When a `CTX-###` ticket is promoted, the folder is renamed to the next `BUG-###` or `WO-###` in sequence, the ticket body is re-templated, and the remote issue is relabeled / retyped in place. The ticket.md frontmatter records `promoted_from: CTX-###` so history is preserved.
- Sprint folders are named `Sprint {N}` — do not use dates
- All `ticket.md` files include frontmatter fields for the remote issue:
  - **GitHub backend**: `github_issue` (issue number) and `project_item_id` (PVTI_…)
  - **Jira backend**: `jira_issue` (issue key, e.g. `JAK-123`) and `jira_issue_id` (numeric id returned by the MCP)
- `plan.md` is always a stub when first created — fill it in before starting work
